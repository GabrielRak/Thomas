# Thomas 
## Financial Analysis Redefined

Thomas is a project that, through the use of Python scripts, will aid in investment decision-making based on knowledge from financial filings.

Two versions of the project will be available for use, each designed for different purposes.

Conversely, the ‘command line’ version will be more parametric, targeting technical users who plan to use this project as a basis for further development.
